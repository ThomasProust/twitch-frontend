# Client

This is the frontend server of the Twitch tracker project.
The corresponding [BackEnd](https://github.com/ThomasProust/twitch-backend.git) of the application is needed for this to be able to run.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.1.0.

## Prerequisites and Setup

In order to to fetch the required data, you first need to modify the `baseUrl` in you environment files `src/environments` to match the one of the [BackEnd](http://github.com/ThomasProust/twitch-backend.git). Also verify that [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) is installed on your machine in order to run the commands hereafter.

Finally make sure that your [BackEnd](https://github.com/ThomasProust/twitch-backend.git) setup is totally done, including seeding the required data in to the database.
If you haven't already, you can use following curl commands:

```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/games -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Far Cry 5"}'
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/games -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Assassin\s creed odyssey"}'
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/games -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege"}'
```
